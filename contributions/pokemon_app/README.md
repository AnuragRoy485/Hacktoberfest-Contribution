# Pokemon App

This web app is going to be a one-paged web app where we are going show to different types of Pokémon and some of their features will also be mentioned there, we will get all these data using a free API resource https://pokeapi.co/. We will set a Load More button, clicking that button the page will load more Pokémon on our webpage (no. of  Pokémon will depend on the limit value that we would have set in our API call ).
