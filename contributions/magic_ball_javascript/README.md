<p>This program mimics the magic ball behaviour developed with Javascript.</p>

<p>Magic 8 ball gives you an awswer when asked a question, in this program we generate a random integer and get a string associated with that number from a switch case. </p>

<p> How to run the program? </p>
<p> You can run the program in any javascript console or simply head to https://playcode.io/new/ and start your game </p>

<p> This is my first contribution to open source, happy hacking! </p>
