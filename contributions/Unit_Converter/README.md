# Unit Converter Tool:
### An efficient tool to convert between different types of units such as Area, Length, Mass, Power, Temperature, Time and Velocity.<h4>

## How it works:</h3>

In this project, I've added a few major units that are used in common-day practice. I have taken a base unit and applied the formula of conversion to come to a value that is correlated to the base unit 

### To further contribute to this repo, you can add different units to this project

In every property (i.e. the i-dimension of the unit and factor arrays) there should be defined a 'primary' or 'base' unit, i.e. one with a conversion factor of 1.  The definitions of the other (secondary) units should use this formula:

(Secondary unit) = (Secondary unit conversion factor) (Primary Unit)
