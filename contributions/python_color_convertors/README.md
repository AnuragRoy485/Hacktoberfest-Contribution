## Summary

When working on website or presentations for clients where specific brand colors are vital - it is often necessary to be able to change a know color reference from one color-space to another.

These two simple Python 3 scripts have been put together to help with this.

## OPERATION

- The first file, hexToDecimal.py asks you to input a standard hexadecimel color-space reference and converts it to standard RGB format as an output
- The second file, RGBToHex.py works in reverse and takes an RGB color-spce input and outputs it as a hexdecimal color-space reference.
